Use of AI
=========

This document tracks all instances where AI tools were used in the development of this project, as required by the course guidelines.

[1]. Tool: Claude (Anthropic)
     Prompt: Generate complete code for an image-to-sentiment pipeline project including FastAPI server, image captioning module, sentiment analysis module, Docker configuration, and comprehensive documentation
     Output: Complete project structure with the following files:
       - src/server.py: FastAPI application with endpoints for image analysis
       - src/image_captioner.py: Image captioning model wrapper using BLIP
       - src/sentiment_analyzer.py: Sentiment analysis model wrapper using DistilBERT
       - src/client.py: Python API client for testing
